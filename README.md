# ðŸ”§ API Endpoints
### 1. Create Product
POST /api/products

Creates a product by forwarding the request to the external mock API, then stores the product's ID and name in memory.

### 2. Get Products (with Filtering and Pagination)
GET /api/products?name=prod&page=1&pageSize=5

Fetches a paginated list of products created through this API. Only IDs stored in memory are queried from the mock API.

### 3. Delete Product
DELETE /api/products/{id}

Deletes the product from the mock API and removes its ID from memory.

### Notes
Products are only tracked if created via this API.
In-memory store is not persistent; restarting the app clears tracked IDs.
